Answers to questions in lab 2
################
(1) What is the last assembly language instruction executed by the
  signal handler function that you write?

(2) After the instruction just identified executes, what is the next
  assembly language instruction executed?

(3) When the signal handler finishes running, it must restore all of
  the registers from the interrupted thread to exactly their values
  before the signal occurred. How is this done?
